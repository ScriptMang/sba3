## Reflection


### Challenges

* I found Tailwind very difficult to use. All the styling done via the class attribute makes it hard to spot my work. I kept misspelling class names. Another issue, I ran into is all elements
started to blend in with each other. I couldn't easily identify elements anymore. 
This was a common issue for me such that I would end up styling the wrong element too. When it came to managing element layouts using flexbox and grid, it  was a nightmare. Again, every style attribute is tied to an element, so its another exhaustive search for a property you changed. 
The other thing I ran into with layout of container was the amount of ways the elements can grouped together as a flexbox or gridbox. I couldn't figure them all out.  

### How I approached solving some challenges

* So to figure out to the flexbox and gridbox containers I drew on top the image they provided.
I drew row and column lines and see if it matched my work.  

### Improvements I would make

* I would start the project all over again and not use tailwind. 
An external style sheet is all I need.
